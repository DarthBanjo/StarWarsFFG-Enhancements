# StarWarsFFG_Enhancements
Module intended to provide minor enhancements for the Foundry VTT FFG Star Wars system

## Scope

This module is designed to supplement the
[StarWarsFFG FoundryVTT system](https://github.com/StarWarsFoundryVTT/StarWarsFFG).
The enhancements included are ones that don't quite make sense to upstream into
the system itself.

## Enhancements

* Launch a customizable Opening Crawl based upon the [Kassel Labs Star Wars Intro Creator](https://github.com/KasselLabs/StarWarsIntroCreator).
* Create Journals with various Datapad templates.
* Easily add animations and sound effects to your attacks.
* Include Star Wars like fonts.
